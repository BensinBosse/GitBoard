# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [git-board-gamma.vercel.app](https://git-board-gamma.vercel.app) :sparkles:.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon <img src="/contributing/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.


### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.


#### Make changes

1. Fork the repository.

2. Install the packages.

3. Create a new branch for your contribution (e.g. `git checkout -b my-new-feature`)

4. Commit your changes (e.g. `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)

5. Add upstream command to your fork (e.g. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/aashay28/GitBoard.git`)

6. Push your changes to your fork (e.g. `git push origin my-new-feature`)

7. Create a pull request
